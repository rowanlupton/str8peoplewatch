Are straight people okay? Stay tuned.

## about
This is a (currently twitter-only) bot that listens for its followers asking if straight people are okay, and responds that, no, they are not.
It will also probably retweet root-level (not reply) tweets directed at it.

## how to use
To use this bot, you will need to:
* make an API key on [dev.twitter.com](https://dev.twitter.com)
* plug the keys into a `.env` file on your computer (or use another method of setting environment variables)
* decide whether you want to continually run it
  * if not, you can run it from your computer
  * if yes, you'll probably want to throw it up on a server, be that a vps, heroku, local raspberry pi, whatever
